# ALERT
## TAGLINE: Get ALerted On Security Trends !!!

## Overview
### The problem the Alert is intended to solve.
	The primary problem that Alert aims to address is the increasing concern of missing or kidnapped persons. In many cases, the initial hours after a person goes missing are critical, and a delay in action can significantly reduce the chances of a successful recovery. SafeSecure intends to bridge this gap by providing real-time location tracking, immediate alert mechanisms, and robust communication channels. The app empowers individuals to send distress signals instantly, allows family members to monitor the whereabouts of their loved ones, and facilitates collaboration with law enforcement to expedite search and rescue operations.


### What the Alert mobile app will not solve
	Alert is not designed to replace professional search and rescue operations or law enforcement investigations. It will not solve underlying societal issues that contribute to kidnappings or disappearances, such as crime rates, human trafficking, or domestic violence. Additionally, the app cannot function without user participation, meaning it relies on individuals to keep their devices charged, maintain GPS functionality, and have an active internet connection. It also does not guarantee recovery but aims to improve the chances through timely alerts and data sharing.


### Who the Alert mobile app will help and/or who the users will be
Alert will primarily help:
- Families and Individuals: It offers peace of mind to families and individuals by enabling them to keep track of their loved ones' whereabouts and receive immediate alerts in emergencies. Such as children, elderly individuals with dementia, or persons with disabilities who might wander off or be at higher risk of getting lost. Family members and guardians are responsible for the safety and well-being of at-risk individuals.

- Law Enforcement Agencies: Provides valuable data and quick access to critical information, which can expedite search and rescue operations. Enforcement agencies can use the app to receive timely information and efficiently coordinate search efforts.
- Community Organizations: Those involved in public safety and missing persons advocacy by giving them a tool to coordinate and communicate more effectively.


### Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale?
Alert is designed to be globally relevant and is independent of a specific locale. However, its effectiveness can vary based on local infrastructure, such as reliable internet connectivity, supportive law enforcement agencies, and the cultural acceptance of technology for personal safety. The app must comply with regional data privacy laws and may require localisation to accommodate different languages and cultural contexts. Its implementation could be more challenging in areas with limited technological infrastructure or where privacy concerns are particularly stringent.
